# My Flappy Bird Inspired Game Project

This is a simple Flappy Bird style game I made using Unity for my CMGT intake.  
I coded the bird's movement, collision detection, and game over logic using C#.  
The game challenges players to navigate through pipes without hitting obstacles.

You can find the BirdScript.cs file in the Assets folder of this repo. It controls the bird's movement and handles collisions.
